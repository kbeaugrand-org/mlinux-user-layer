# For MTR WiFi only:
# NOTE: udev rules will bring up wlan0 automatically if a wifi device is detected
# and the wlan0 interface is defined, therefore an "auto wlan0" line is not needed.
# If "auto wlan0" is also specified, startup conflicts may result.

#
# For Conduit WiFi:
# You must configure wpa_supplicant.conf as appropriate for your WiFi access point
# and its security.  The "pre-up" section is needed to create the VAP device,
# wifi0.  udhcpc_opts should be used to prevent DHCP from giving up too soon.  The
# default timeout is less than 10 seconds, and in some circumstances is not enough
# time for wifi to connect. The udhcpc options specified below are in addition to
# those preconfigured in the ifup program.  The option "-t" specifies the number
# of DHCP retries.  By default each trial is 3 seconds long.  As specified here,
# udhcpc will try for thirty seconds. The option "-b" specifies that if the
# attempts are made and all fail, the boot will proceed, and the udhcpc program
# will continue to periodically attempt to reach the DHCP server.  Without the -b
# option, udhcpc will fail and abort if the server is not reached within the
# specified timeout.  The boot will continue after the timeout, but the network
# will never be connected without some other intervention.
#
# Specifying "-t 0" results in udhcpc not running in the background, regardless
# of the presence of "-b".  This causes udhcpc to enter a loop trying to reach
# the DHCP server, and only relinquising control to the boot (or ifup) if the
# server responds.
#
# The udhcpc_opts parameter will result in the following invocation
# of udhcpc from ifup:
# udhcpc -R -n -p /var/run/udhcpc.wifi0.pid -i wifi0 -t 10 -b
#
